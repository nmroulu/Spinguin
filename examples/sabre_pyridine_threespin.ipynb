    "This is a simple example of a SABRE simulation of pyridine. The spin system consists of the hydride protons and one ligand proton. Chemical exchange and relaxation are not simulated. The simulation is performed near the energy level anticrossing field. Therefore, we find a coherent oscillation between the quantum states. This example takes a few seconds to run on a laptop with 11th generation i5 processor."
