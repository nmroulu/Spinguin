    "In this example, we will perform an inversion-recovery experiment on a Pyridine molecule, which is a great example showcasing the functionality of the Spinguin package. The simulation incorporates all NMR-active spins of the Pyridine molecule (all 5 protons and the quadrupolar nitrogen-14), and the performance is increased by utilizing the restricted Liouville space. The coherent interactions (Zeeman, isotropic shift, and $J$-coupling) as well as incoherent interactions (dipolar coupling, chemical shielding anisotropy, quadrupolar coupling, and scalar relaxation of the second kind) are included in the simulation."
