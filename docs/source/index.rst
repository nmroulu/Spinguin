Spinguin
========

Spinguin is a user-friendly Python package designed for versatile numerical
spin-dynamics simulations in liquid state. It offers tools for performing
simulations using restricted basis sets in Liouville space, enabling the use of
large spin systems with more than 10 spins on consumer-level hardware. Spinguin
supports the simulation of coherent dynamics, relaxation, and chemical exchange
processes.
