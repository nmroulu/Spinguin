Spinguin
========

Spinguin is a user-friendly Python package designed for versatile numerical
spin-dynamics simulations in liquid state. It offers tools for performing
simulations using restricted basis sets, enabling the use of large spin systems
with more than 10 spins on consumer-level hardware. Spinguin supports the
simulation of coherent dynamics, relaxation, and chemical exchange processes.
